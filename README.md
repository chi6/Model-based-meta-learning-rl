# model based meta learning rl

## Initial algorithm set

* [v] learning to adapt
* [v] new adaption method (In developing)

## Getting started
The sampling method is based on rllab.

#### Running Experiments
Meta training

```
python self_implement_learning_to_adapt/main.py (learning to adapt)
python new_adaption_method_in_developing/main.py (new method)
```
Meta testing

```
python self_implement_learning_to_adapt/MPC_test.py (learning to adapt)
python new_adaption_method_in_developing/MPC_test.py (new method)
```
